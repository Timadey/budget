### Ready made database
A [`budget.sql file`](budget.sql) is availabe at the root of this repo but it's outdated. If you're going to use it. <b>Ensure that you do the following after importing</b>

* Delete the `category_id` column in `books` table
* Rename the `type` column in `transactions` table to `category_id` or simply create a new `category_id` column and delete `type`
